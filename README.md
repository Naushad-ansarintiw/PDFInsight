## 🚀 Getting Started

Some basic Git commands are:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Naushad-ansarintiw/PDFInsight.git
    $ cd project
    $ pnpm ci

Now, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```
I recomment pnpm as a Node package manager. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
